Hello, the C3 Guide is a guide to the C3 Programming Language. It is a work in progress, and will be continually updated.

## What is C3?

C3 is a system programming language based on C. It is an evolution of C enabling the same paradigms and 
retaining the same syntax as far as possible.

## Features

- Full C ABI compatibility  
- Module system 
- Generic modules
- Design by contract
- Zero overhead errors
- Semantic macro system
- First-class SIMD vector types
- Struct subtyping
- Safe array access using slices
